      <div class="content"><p>One of the variables you&#x27;ll input into those calculators is a prediction about the return your portfolio will earn. No one person has a crystal-clear crystal ball, so I like to occasionally cast my gaze across the financial services universe to see what various firms are prognosticating.</p><p>What follows are the results of a recent investigation into current projections. Keep in mind that these are not predictions for the next year or two, but rather the next decade or so (depending on the prognosticator). A blank space indicates that a firm did not provide a forecast for that particular asset class.</p><p>few general observations that apply to most (but not all) of the firms&#x27; predictions: 3</p><p>Each firm expects the overall U.S. stock market to earn returns in the mid-single digits. This is due to the high current stock market valuations. For example, the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) is around 40. The only other time it was at this level was toward the peak of the dot-com bubble.<br/>U.S. small caps will outperform U.S. large caps by a slight margin. This is largely due to valuations. However, as my colleague Meilin Quinn recently wrote, small caps could have some additional tailwinds, such as lower interest rates, earnings growth, and reshoring trends.<br/>Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are expected to provide returns that exceed the overall stock market. That would be a change from what we&#x27;ve seen over the past decade, during which REITs posted an annualized return of 6.4%, far behind the 15.5% annualized return from the S&amp;P 500.<br/>International stocks are predicted to continue the trend that began last year and outperform U.S. stocks. International stocks returned more than 32% in 2025, their best year since 2009. Also, their outperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500, which returned 18%, was the largest margin since 1993. So far, this year is looking similar. International stocks have returned more than 9% so far in 2026, as of the market&#x27;s close on Feb. 19, compared to 0.3% for the S&amp;P 500. According to Ben Carlson of Ritholtz Wealth Management, this is the best start of the year in terms of international outperformance over U.S. stocks since 1995. Despite the recent outperformance, international stocks are still cheaper than U.S. stocks. According to Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for the S&amp;P 500 is 40% above the forward P/E for the MSCI World ex-U.S. index.<br/>And now, a huge caveat: If you looked at these firms&#x27; predictions from five to 10 years ago, you would have seen very similar patterns: single-digit expectations from U.S. stocks and outperformance from small caps and international stocks. And they were all wrong.</p><p>So, take the relative predictions with a grain of salt. But I believe it&#x27;s dangerously optimistic to assume double-digit returns when using a calculator to estimate whether you&#x27;re on track to have enough money when you need it.</p><p>While the future returns of stocks are very difficult to predict, we can feel more comfortable that the above projections for bonds will end up being pretty close. That&#x27;s because the returns from bonds over a period of five to 10 years are highly correlated to interest rates at the starting point. With the 10-year Treasury yielding 4.1% and investment-grade corporate bonds yielding, on average, 4.8%, returns between 4% and 5% from bonds are a strong possibility.</p><p>However, a significant economic downturn could shake things up. That would likely result in lower returns from corporate bonds (due to default risk), higher returns from Treasuries (since they may be bid up due to a flight to safety), and lower returns from cash (assuming the Federal Reserve would likely rapidly cut rates).</p><p>Apportion the non-stock side of your portfolio to account for your timeline, risk tolerance, and tax considerations.
